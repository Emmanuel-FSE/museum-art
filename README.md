Name: Emmax Musuem Art
Description: This is an app that displays data about works of art fetching from a public API.
             The public API I'm using is called claveland museum api, for the time I have used it it has proved to
             be slow when rendering the pictures but alot can be done to improve the site's performance.
             All the data needed for an art is provided from description of a picture to the date it was created.
             If you get excited about a certain picture, there is a like button that you can click and a like will be
             dropped for that specific image.
             In addition, I have intergrated a search option that lets you search the name of you favourite artist and it displays 
             his/her name and the country of origin.
             
             
             I have used HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT to make all this work.
             For styling I have involved some bits of bootstrap to add the appearance of the program.
             'Enjoy your use amigo'
